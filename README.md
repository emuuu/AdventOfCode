# AdventOfCode

Solutions for the https://adventofcode.com/ puzzles including unit tests for each day.

To use it just write your personal input data in a text file (default path D:\AdventOfCode\input.txt). If your want to use another path you simply can edit the appsettings.json or change it temporarily in the app.

# Make your own edits
If you want to make your own changes (like testing other solutions), just edit the AdventOfCode2019.cs, thats where all the fun happens.
The rest of the app is just infrastructure.
